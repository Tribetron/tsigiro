    description:
      "From the outside this house looks snug and comfortable. It has been built with cypress wood and has marble decorations. Small, rounded windows let in plenty of light and have been added to the house in a fairly symmetrical pattern. The house is equipped with a small kitchen and two modern bathrooms, it also has a spacious living room, three bedrooms, a large dining room and a spacious basement. The building is square shaped. The house is fully surrounded by overgrown wooden overhanging panels. The second floor is the same size as the first, but part of it hangs over the edge of the floor below, creating an overhang on one side and a balcony on the other. This floor has a very different style than the floor below. The roof is low, triangular and layered and is covered with red ceramic tiles. One small chimney sits at the side of the house. Rows of small windows let in plenty of light to the rooms below the roof. The house itself is surrounded by a modest, childsafe garden covered mostly in grass and with a children's playground in the center.",
